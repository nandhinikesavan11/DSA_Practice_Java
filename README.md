# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice in Java

This repository contains my Java-based solutions for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The aim is to strengthen core programming concepts and enhance problem-solving skills.

To explore specific data structures and their associated problem solutions, navigate through the topic-wise folders in the repository. Each directory corresponds to a core DSA concept and contains multiple Java implementations.

## It helps me to
- Practice and master key DSA patterns  
- Write clean and optimized Java solutions  
- Organize problems by topic for easy reference  
- Track progress over time

## Topics Covered

The repository is organized into folders based on DSA topics:
- Arrays and Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- Sliding Window  
- Stack and Queue  
- Binary Search  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees and Binary Trees  
- Tries  
- Heaps / Priority Queues  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Graphs and Traversals  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Intervals  
- Dynamic Programming (1D and 2D)  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Math and Geometry  
- Miscellaneous (Strings, Sets, Custom Logic, etc.)
